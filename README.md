# adventure-game
A simple text-based game I made for a class project.
It's the first python program I've written.
The goal of the game is to fight the monster terrorizing the nearby village and collect the bounty on it's head.
Being a simple version, choices are picked via the 1, 2, 3 number keys, they are the only valid choices, any other input will ask the player to try again.
This game uses a random choice function to select a monster at random each time the game is played. It also uses randint to generate the bounty on the monster, that the player collects when they win the game.
There is an extra fight step if the player picks the sword from the cave(inspired by "Our Flag Means Death").
If the player returns to the cave after already taking a weapon, they are unable to pick up another, and go back to the field. 
I had a lot of fun putting this together, I easily spent twenty hours on it.
